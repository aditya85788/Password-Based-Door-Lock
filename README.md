# Password-Based-Door-Lock
The project is a basic prototype of a door lock which requires a unique password from to gain access through the door.
The purpose of this project is to provide security at (house, ATM, office etc.).In this system the user will have to register a unique password to gain access. The information will be stored in data base.
Whenever the right password will be received, the controller will accordingly give instruction
to dc motor. Dc motor will perform the action on door unlocking. We want to utilize the
electronic technology to build an integrated and fully customized home security system at a
reasonable cost.

Simulation performed in **Proteus** and code written in **Keil** Software.
